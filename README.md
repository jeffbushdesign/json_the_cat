### Executing program

1. In terminal navigate to where the file is being stored
2. Type ```node index.js bengal```

Output --> Code will consult the cat api and return a description of the breed that you entered.
In this example, it would be a description of bengal:

"Bengals are a lot of fun to live with, but they're definitely not the cat for everyone, or for first-time cat owners. Extremely intelligent, curious and active, they demand a lot of interaction and woe betide the owner who doesn't provide it."
